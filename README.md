# A* Pathfinding Algorithm in Java

This is a simple Java program that demonstrates the A* pathfinding algorithm. The program finds the shortest path between two points in a grid, considering obstacles.

## Features

- A Algorithm*: Implements the A* algorithm to find the shortest path.
- Grid Representation: Uses a grid-based representation of the map.
- Obstacles: Supports obstacles in the grid.
- Visualization: Provides a simple visualization of the pathfinding process.
- Map Changing: Create your own obstacles and save them to the system
- Optional Diagonal movement

## Requirements

Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.0 or higher

## Installation
Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/astar-pathfinding-java.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd astar-pathfinding-java
```

## Usage

Compile the program:

```bash
javac AStarPathfinding.java
```

Run the program:

```bash
java AStarPathfinding
```

The program will display a grid and demonstrate the A* pathfinding algorithm in action.
